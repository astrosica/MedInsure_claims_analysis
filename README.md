# MedInsure Claims Analysis

MedInsure is a medical insurance company that helps thousands of Americans cover the cost of preventative care and medical bills. They offer four plan types (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum) with different premiums and claim coverage rates. In 2019, MedInsure launched a series of new campaign categories covering topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to report on marketing, signup, and claims metrics to investigate the campaign category performance and provide recommendations on future budget allocation with two goals in mind: (1) increasing the number of customer signups and (2) raising awareness of MedInsure's brand across the country. I created a PowerPoint presentation for the marketing team to present my insights and recommendations. 

## Interactive Tableau Dashboard

The interactive dashboard can be found in Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/astrosica/viz/MedInsureClaimsDashboard/Dashboard). This dashboard enables users to filter by plan type, campaign type, and customer state, focusing on marketing, signup, and claim metrics.

## Data Structure

The data consisted of 70K records over three tables: (1) marketing campaigns, (2) customer signups and demographics, and (3) claim information. The entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this dataset is shown below:
